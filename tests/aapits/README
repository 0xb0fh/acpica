CONTENTS

   This directory (aapits) is located in tools directory
   of the ACPICA source tree and contains sources of
   ACPICA API validation Test Suite (AAPITS)
  
   AAPITS verifies, in emulating mode, conformity of the ACPICA API 
   implementation to the definitions in ACPI Component Architecture 
   Programmer Reference (ACPICA ProgRef).

   There are 9 test cases relevant to the following chapters
   ACPICA ProgRef respectivly:

   Test Case       Chapter

   atinit          6.1 Subsystem Initialization, Shutdown, and Status
   atmemory        6.2 Memory Management
   athardware      6.3 ACPI Hardware Management
   attable         6.4 ACPI Table Management
   atnamespace     6.5 ACPI Namespace Access
   atresource      6.6 ACPI Resource Management
   atfixedevent    6.7 ACPI Fixed Event Management
   atgpe           6.8 ACPI General Purpose Event Management
   athandlers      6.9 ACPI Miscellaneous Handler Support

spec
   Directory which tests specification are located in.

atinit.c
atinit.h
atmemory.c
atmemory.h
athardware.c
athardware.h
attable.c
attable.h
atnamespace.c
atnamespace.h
atresource.c
atresource.h
atfixedevent.c
atfixedevent.h
atgpe.c
atgpe.h
athandlers.c
athandlers.h
   Each test case is represented by the pair of .c and .h files with
   the same filename.

atcommon.h
atexec.c
atosxfwrap.c
atosxfwrap.h
atosxfctrl.c
atosxfctrl.h
atmain.c                  
   Auxiliary testing modules and TS main file.

oswinxf.c
osunixxf.c
   Relavant copies of the same files from the os_specific/service_layers
   directory updated to be used in the AAPITS utlility with the sed command:

   sed -i s/^AcpiOs/AcpiOsActual/ os*xf.c

   Then add the following line:

   #include "acdebug.h"
   + #include "atosxfwrap.h"


asl
   Directory which supporting ASL codes are located in.

bin
   Directory which supporting shell utility are located in.

AcpiApiTS.dsp
   MSVC project to compile the TS utility under Windows.

   Usage: copy to the generate/msvc catalog and insert into
          the AcpiComponents.dsw workspace.

Makefile
   Makefile based on AcpiExec utility one supporting
   compilation of the TS utility under Linux.

   Usage: copy the aapits directory tree to the relevant acpica-unix-*/tools
          directory and perform the make command to generate the aapits binary,
		  to run the paticular test type the following:

	./aapits <test case> <test num> <aml dir>

	Here <test case> is from 1 (init) to 9 (handlers),
	<test num> is the appropriate assertion number (see the files in spec dir),
	<aml dir> is the directory with the auxiliary aml files (actually it is
	./tmp/aml directory which is created by make in the asl directory), for
	example, to run assertion 0041 of Hardware Management test case type:

	./aapits 3 41 ./tmp/aml
