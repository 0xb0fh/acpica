   How to install.

There are two ways to install AML tests (see A and B below)
on Unix-like environment.

A.

   > cd aslts
   > make install

B.

   > aslts/bin/Do 0 aslts

were 'aslts' is a root directory of the test suite,
its base name must be just 'aslts'.

The resulting AML codes of tests will be
located into aslts/tmp/aml directory which one
also is created automatically by make-install.

The resulting AML codes of ASL tests are located into
directories:

   with optimization:

       aslts/tmp/aml/opt/32
       aslts/tmp/aml/opt/64

    without optimization:

       aslts/tmp/aml/nopt/32
       aslts/tmp/aml/nopt/64

If directories aslts/tmp/aml... don't exist they are
created with the precautions.
